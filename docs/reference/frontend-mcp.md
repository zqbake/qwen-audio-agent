# Frontend MCP client

The frontend MCP client is the standards-based extension boundary for adding
chatbot tools without coupling them to a realtime provider or a backend Agent.
It is separate from the dedicated Web Search provider: Web Search keeps its
small built-in fallback, while general MCP servers are configured by the user.

The Gateway discovers the explicitly enabled tools at startup, gives them
stable names, and adds them to each Realtime session through the shared
frontend tool registry and executor.

## Configuration

Set `QWEN_AUDIO_FRONTEND_MCP_CONFIG` to a versioned JSON file:

```env
QWEN_AUDIO_FRONTEND_MCP_CONFIG=/absolute/path/to/frontend-mcp.json
DOCUMENT_MCP_AUTHORIZATION=Bearer replace-me
```

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "servers": {
    "documents": {
      "enabled": true,
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
      "connectTimeoutMs": 8000,
      "headers": {
        "authorization": "${DOCUMENT_MCP_AUTHORIZATION}"
      },
      "tools": {
        "search": {
          "enabled": true,
          "readOnly": true,
          "timeoutMs": 8000,
          "maxResultBytes": 32768,
          "maxCallsPerTurn": 2,
          "description": "Search the user's configured document source."
        },
        "create_issue": {
          "enabled": true,
          "readOnly": false,
          "approval": "required",
          "description": "Create an issue in the configured tracker."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each exposed tool receives a stable model-visible name:
`mcp__<server>__<tool>`. Tools omitted from `tools`, or without
`enabled: true`, are never exposed.

## Current policy

- Streamable HTTP is the initial transport.
- Discovery and connection have a bounded timeout (8 seconds by default).
- Remote servers require HTTPS. Loopback HTTP is allowed only without headers.
- Header values may reference one exact environment variable with
  `${VARIABLE}`. A missing variable is a configuration error.
- Every enabled tool must explicitly declare `readOnly`. A writable tool must
  also set `approval: "required"`; otherwise it is rejected at startup.
- Writable operations execute only after a natural-language user confirmation.
  Each confirmation covers one pending operation exactly once. Rejection,
  replay, and a reconnect before confirmation all fail closed; there is no
  session-wide automatic approval.
- Schemas, descriptions, calls, time, and results are bounded. MCP results are
  treated as untrusted data and cannot override system or user instructions.
- If an enabled tool is absent or invalid during discovery, that server fails
  closed and exposes no partial tool set.

Restart the Gateway after changing this file. Secrets should be passed through
environment variables instead of committed to JSON.
