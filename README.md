## Agent Presence

Real conversation should not leave you waiting after a single sentence, nor
should it grind to a halt just because the Agent is looking something up,
calling a tool, or working on a task.

Conversation should keep flowing, and the Agent should always be present.

That is why we built **qwen-audio-agent**—a realtime voice runtime that keeps
Agents talking, working, and present. Whether chatting with you, thinking
through a problem, or working on a task, your Agent remains in the
conversation. It listens, responds, and when the task is complete, naturally
tells you:

"It's ready."

## Conversation Continues, Tasks Too

Conversation doesn't stop for background tasks; when a task completes, the
result naturally returns to the current conversation:

### Core Features

- Full-duplex realtime voice interaction, natural interruption, and sustained multi-turn conversation
- DashScope Qwen Audio and Qwen3.5 Omni Realtime model selection from one shared model catalog
- One-click selection of your preferred coding Agent, reusing existing tools, MCP, and Skills
- Frontend conversation and background tasks run in parallel; ask about progress or cancel at any time
- Create multiple independent tasks executed asynchronously by the backend Agent, with continuous status tracking
- Task results automatically return to the current conversation, supporting follow-up questions and modifications
- WebUI, terminal TUI, and desktop floating orb (macOS / Windows / Linux)
- Desktop auto-sleep disconnects cloud Realtime without stopping submitted tasks; wake with a configurable shortcut or the local wake word
- Per-user long-term personalization and cross-session memory

## Architecture

![qwen-audio-agent architecture](docs/architecture-overview-en.png)

Questions that can be answered directly are answered immediately; when tools
or sustained processing are needed, the task is delegated to the backend Agent.
Throughout, the user always faces the same assistant.

Ratings reflect current integration completeness, compatibility, and
verification level: five stars indicate a thoroughly tested recommended
integration; four stars indicate active development or not yet fully verified.
For detailed configuration and capability boundaries, see the [configuration guide](docs/configuration.md).

## Installation

Requires Node.js 22.22.2+ or 24.15.0+, npm 10+. One-click install (recommended):

```bash
npm install -g qwen-audio-agent
```

For building from source, installing from GitHub, and obtaining a DashScope
API Key, see the [installation guide](docs/getting-started/install.md).

## Quick Start

1. Create your config and fill in the API Key:

```bash
qwenaudio config
```

```dotenv
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your-key
# Voice frontend model: Omni Flash/Plus or Audio Flash/Plus (Audio Plus is default)
QWEN_AUDIO_REALTIME_MODEL=qwen-audio-3.0-realtime-plus
# Backend Agent: optional, leave empty or set to none for frontend-only mode
AGENT_PROTOCOL=openclaw
# Backend model: can be empty; if empty, uses the Agent's own user config
QWEN_AUDIO_AGENT_BACKEND_MODEL=qwen3.7-max
```

> Uses DashScope realtime voice frontend by default; alternatively, switch to a local [speech-to-speech frontend](docs/voice-frontends/speech-to-speech.md), no cloud API Key needed.
> `qwen3.5-omni-flash-realtime` and `qwen3.5-omni-plus-realtime`
> accept text, audio, and image at the model level. This release transports text and
> audio only; image/frame and native-video transport remain disabled until their client and
> Gateway paths are implemented.

The Desktop app or `qwenaudio config set --realtime-model <id>` configures the single
Gateway-wide model. Restart the Gateway after a CLI change. WebUI and TUI display the active
model but do not override it.

2. Start the Gateway, then open another terminal to start the TUI (or use `qwenaudio webui` for the browser UI):

```bash
qwenaudio        # Terminal 1: Gateway
qwenaudio tui    # Terminal 2: TUI
```

For full configuration options, speech-to-speech frontend setup, and TUI
platform notes, see [quick start](docs/getting-started/quickstart.md),
[voice frontends](docs/voice-frontends/speech-to-speech.md), and
[TUI notes](docs/getting-started/tui.md).

## Examples and Scenario Expansion

The current qwen-audio-agent framework focuses on desktop productivity: users
can keep talking with the Agent in realtime while delegating tool use, file
work, code changes, and long-running tasks to the backend Agent.

This "foreground conversation + background task" design is not limited to
desktop use. It can also expand to more scenarios where the Agent can both
chat naturally and get real work done.

| Scenario | Description | Link | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop | Voice chat, progress follow-up, tools, and background tasks. | [Docs][desktop-docs] | Available |
| Smart cockpit | Vehicle control, navigation, music, weather, and services. | [Example][car-example] | Available |
| Customer support | Issue clarification, order lookup, tickets, and human handoff. | TBD | Planned |
| Embodied intelligence | Voice commands, action execution, inspection, and exception feedback. | TBD | Planned |
| Livestream assistant | Audience interaction, product explanation, coupons, and risk reminders. | TBD | Exploratory |

This repository includes a smart cockpit voice Agent example with vehicle
control, navigation, music, weather, web search, flash-buy workflows, and a
car UI:

```bash
cp examples/car/.env.example examples/car/.env.local
npm install --prefix examples/car/server
npm install --prefix examples/car/react-app
npm run example:car:server   # Terminal 1: car Agent server
npm run example:car:web      # Terminal 2: car UI
```

See [examples/car](https://github.com/QwenAudio/qwen-audio-agent/tree/main/examples/car) for details.

## Desktop App

The desktop app provides a floating voice orb that stays on your desktop,
with a built-in Gateway, automatic idle sleep, a configurable wake shortcut,
and a local voice wake word. Sleep disconnects the Realtime frontend while
keeping the app, Gateway, backend Agent, and submitted tasks alive; it is not
the same as quitting or restarting the desktop app. Completed tasks can wake
the app and return their results to the conversation.
Download the installer for your platform from the releases page, or build
from source:

```bash
npm run desktop:build:local      # macOS
npm run desktop:build:win        # Windows
npm run desktop:build:linux      # Linux (AppImage + deb, no signing)
```

For visuals, orb behavior, and build instructions, see the [desktop documentation](docs/desktop/overview.md).

## Backend Agent

`AGENT_PROTOCOL` is optional. Leave empty for frontend-only mode; when set,
it reuses the installed Agent's user-level models, tools, MCP, Skills, and
authentication. The CLI and desktop app share one onboarding contract: reuse
an existing Agent when available, install only missing components when the
user requests one-click installation, and keep installation, configuration,
and runtime readiness as separate states. Configuration stays backend-owned;
the desktop app opens the Agent's native setup entry instead of copying or
rewriting its credentials.

```bash
qwenaudio setup   # View available backend Agents
```

For Agent selection, persistent background service, generic ACP entry, and
permission modes, see the [backend Agent documentation](docs/backends/overview.md).

## Personalization and Memory

User data is stored in `~/.config/qwaudio/` (`ASSISTANT.md`, `USER.md`,
`MEMORY.md`, `tasks.json`, `logs/`), kept local only, never
committed to the repository. See [assistant profile, user preferences, and memory](docs/reference/memory.md).

## Important Notes

- Do not store passwords, API Keys, verification codes, or access tokens in user preferences or conversation.
- Microphone audio and realtime conversation are sent to the configured Realtime frontend service (DashScope or speech-to-speech).
- Background tasks may invoke the selected Agent's models, tools, MCP, and external services.
- `full` permission allows the backend to execute commands and modify files; use only in trusted projects.
- The Gateway is for local use only; do not expose it directly to the network or public internet.
- On Linux / Windows with full-duplex without echo cancellation, wear headphones.

For detailed data boundaries, see the [privacy notice](PRIVACY.md); for
network and permission configuration, see the [configuration guide](docs/configuration.md).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

```bash
npm run dev       # Gateway + WebUI hot reload
npm run desktop   # Desktop floating orb (macOS / Windows)
```
