// Contract surface an external client (desktop app, CLI, WebUI, or a platform
// integrator) may rely on when talking to this Gateway.
//
// Versioning: bump the minor for an additive capability and the major for a
// breaking change to any HTTP endpoint or Realtime event named in
// GATEWAY_CAPABILITIES. Clients should branch on a capability rather than
// compare product versions, so a Gateway that predates a feature degrades
// instead of failing.
//
// Every capability listed here is locked by a test (see docs/contract.md);
// anything not listed is internal and may change in any release.
//
// 5.0.0 removes the backend-controlled Task presentation envelope. Backend
// outcomes now expose factual `content` plus optional typed `artifacts`; the
// frontend Chatbot owns spoken expression and each Conversation Client owns
// rendering. It also publishes the existing Realtime event model as the
// replaceable Conversation Client boundary.
// 4.0.0 replaces the dual workId/jobId Task identity with one short `id`
// (`task_id` in model tool results) and adds task.updated snapshots for
// normalized backend messages and artifacts.
// 3.1.0 adds bounded citations to final assistant transcript events.
// 3.0.0 gives public Tasks A2A-aligned work states and first-class artifact
// and authorization values. This replaces the 2.x `active`
// state and opaque result metadata, so event consumers must branch on the
// capability below before reading the new fields.
// 2.1.0 adds an opt-in AG-UI projection while preserving the native stream.
// 2.0.0 succeeds the 1.x line of the feat/embedded-gateway-host-contract
// fork (last 1.7.0). The major bump is semantic, not cosmetic: capabilities
// that line advertised (gateway.embedded-lifecycle, gateway.self-terminate,
// desktop.settings-window, …) are not part of this contract, and a removed
// capability is a breaking change. Hosts migrating from the fork must branch
// on the capability list below, never on the version number.
